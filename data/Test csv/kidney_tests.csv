Creatinine,Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Waste product from muscle metabolism used to estimate kidney filtration.,0.74,1.35,range,mg/dL,Elevated creatinine can indicate impaired kidney function; high muscle mass may raise baseline levels.
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN),Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Nitrogenous waste from protein breakdown; measured to assess renal function.,7.0,20.0,range,mg/dL,High BUN can result from high protein intake or dehydration; used with creatinine to evaluate kidneys.
eGFR (CKD‑EPI),Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine.,90.0,,greater_than,mL/min/1.73 m²,Values below 90 suggest reduced kidney function; high muscle mass can affect accuracy.
Cystatin C,Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Protein produced by all nucleated cells; alternative filtration marker less affected by muscle mass.,0.6,1.0,range,mg/L,Useful when high muscle mass makes creatinine less reliable; elevated levels indicate reduced filtration.
Uric Acid (serum),Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Waste product from purine metabolism excreted by kidneys.,3.5,7.2,range,mg/dL,High uric acid can cause gout and kidney stones; high‑protein or creatine use can elevate levels.
Urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratio (ACR),Kidney Function,Urine Renal Panel,Detects small amounts of albumin leaking into urine; marker of early kidney damage.,0.0,30.0,less_than,mg/g,Elevated ACR signals glomerular stress; may occur with high blood pressure or heavy compound use.
Creatinine Clearance (estimated),Kidney Function,Calculated Ratios,Estimated rate at which kidneys clear creatinine from blood based on urine and serum measurements.,90.0,,greater_than,mL/min,Provides a more accurate measure of filtration; values below 90 warrant further evaluation.
BUN/Creatinine Ratio,Kidney Function,Calculated Ratios,Ratio comparing BUN to creatinine; helps identify prerenal versus intrinsic renal causes.,9.0,20.0,range,ratio,High ratio indicates dehydration or high protein diet; low ratio suggests intrinsic renal disease.
Urinalysis – Specific Gravity,Kidney Function,Urinalysis Panel,Measure of urine concentration relative to water.,1.005,1.03,range,,Shows hydration status; extremely low or high values reflect over‑hydration or dehydration.
Urinalysis – pH,Kidney Function,Urinalysis Panel,Acidity or alkalinity of urine sample.,4.5,8.0,range,,"Extremes in pH may reflect diet, supplements or risk of kidney stones."
Urinalysis – Protein,Kidney Function,Urinalysis Panel,Presence of protein in urine; normally absent.,0.0,150.0,less_than,mg/day,Protein in urine suggests kidney stress; can occur transiently after heavy training but should resolve.
Urinalysis – Blood (RBC),Kidney Function,Urinalysis Panel,Detection of red blood cells in urine sample.,0.0,3.0,less_than,per HPF,Microscopic hematuria can occur from intense exercise; persistent blood requires investigation.
Urinalysis – Leukocytes,Kidney Function,Urinalysis Panel,White blood cells in urine indicating inflammation or infection.,0.0,5.0,less_than,per HPF,Presence of leukocytes suggests urinary tract infection or kidney inflammation.
Urine Sodium (spot),Kidney Function,Electrolyte Urine Panel,Concentration of sodium excreted in a spot urine sample.,40.0,220.0,range,mmol/L,Helps assess sodium balance and guide adjustments during cutting or dehydration.
Urine Potassium (spot),Kidney Function,Electrolyte Urine Panel,Concentration of potassium in a spot urine sample.,25.0,125.0,range,mmol/L,"Tracks potassium losses, especially when using diuretics or cutting water."
Urine Chloride (spot),Kidney Function,Electrolyte Urine Panel,Chloride concentration in a spot urine sample.,40.0,200.0,range,mmol/L,Helps assess acid–base status and dietary salt intake.
Beta‑2 Microglobulin (serum),Kidney Function,Serum Renal Panel,Low molecular weight protein filtered by the kidneys; rises when tubules are damaged.,0.8,2.4,range,mg/L,"Elevated levels indicate tubular dysfunction, important when using nephrotoxic compounds."
