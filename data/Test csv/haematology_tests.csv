White Blood Cell Count (WBC),Haematology,Complete Blood Count,Total number of white blood cells per liter of blood.,4.0,11.0,range,x10^9/L,"High or low WBC can indicate infection, inflammation or immune suppression from overtraining."
Red Blood Cell Count (RBC),Haematology,Complete Blood Count,Number of red blood cells per liter of blood.,4.5,6.0,range,x10^12/L,High RBC increases oxygen delivery but thickens blood; low RBC causes anemia and fatigue.
Hemoglobin (Hgb),Haematology,Complete Blood Count,Oxygen‑carrying protein in red blood cells.,13.5,17.5,range,g/dL,Elevated hemoglobin improves endurance but thickens blood; low levels cause fatigue.
Hematocrit (Hct),Haematology,Complete Blood Count,Percentage of blood volume occupied by red cells.,40.0,52.0,range,%,High hematocrit thickens blood and increases clot risk; low values reduce oxygen carrying capacity.
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Average volume of individual red blood cells.,80.0,100.0,range,fL,Low MCV suggests iron deficiency; high MCV may indicate B12 or folate deficiency.
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell.,27.0,33.0,range,pg,Low MCH indicates hypochromic red cells; high MCH may reflect macrocytosis.
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red cells.,32.0,36.0,range,g/dL,Low MCHC indicates hypochromia; high MCHC is rare but may occur in hereditary conditions.
Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Measurement of variation in red blood cell size.,11.5,14.5,range,%,High RDW suggests mixed nutrient deficiencies or bone marrow stress.
Platelet Count,Haematology,Platelet Panel,Number of platelets per liter of blood.,150.0,400.0,range,x10^9/L,High platelets increase clot risk; low platelets impair clotting and recovery.
Mean Platelet Volume (MPV),Haematology,Platelet Panel,Average size of platelets in a blood sample.,7.5,11.5,range,fL,High MPV may indicate increased platelet turnover; low MPV suggests bone marrow suppression.
Neutrophils %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Percentage of neutrophils among white blood cells.,40.0,70.0,range,%,High neutrophil percentage may indicate infection or inflammation; low percentage suggests risk of infection.
Lymphocytes %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Percentage of lymphocytes among white blood cells.,20.0,45.0,range,%,Low lymphocyte percentage can indicate stress or immune suppression from intense training.
Monocytes %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Percentage of monocytes among white blood cells.,2.0,8.0,range,%,Elevated monocytes may reflect chronic inflammation or recovery from infection.
Eosinophils %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Percentage of eosinophils among white blood cells.,1.0,6.0,range,%,"High eosinophils can indicate allergies, asthma or parasitic infection."
Basophils %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Percentage of basophils among white blood cells.,0.0,2.0,range,%,Basophils are rarely elevated; high levels may indicate chronic inflammation or blood disorders.
Neutrophils Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute number of neutrophils in blood.,1.8,7.5,range,x10^9/L,Low absolute neutrophils increase infection risk; high values may reflect acute stress or infection.
Lymphocytes Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute lymphocyte count.,1.0,4.8,range,x10^9/L,Low absolute lymphocytes may signal overtraining or immunosuppression; high levels may occur with infection.
Monocytes Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute monocyte count.,0.2,0.8,range,x10^9/L,Elevated monocytes absolute may reflect chronic inflammation; low counts are uncommon.
Eosinophils Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute eosinophil count.,0.0,0.5,range,x10^9/L,Elevated eosinophils absolute can indicate allergic reactions or parasitic infections.
Basophils Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute basophil count.,0.0,0.2,range,x10^9/L,High basophil counts are rare; persistent elevation needs medical evaluation.
Reticulocyte Count %,Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Percentage of young red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the blood.,0.5,2.5,range,%,Elevated reticulocytes indicate increased red cell production; low levels may signal bone marrow suppression.
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR),Haematology,Inflammation Panel,Rate at which red blood cells settle in a tube over one hour.,0.0,15.0,less_than,mm/hr,High ESR signals systemic inflammation or infection; low ESR is generally normal.
Haptoglobin,Haematology,Protein Panel,Protein that binds free hemoglobin released from red blood cells.,30.0,200.0,range,mg/dL,Low haptoglobin indicates hemolysis or liver disease; high values may occur with inflammation.
Erythropoietin (EPO),Haematology,Hormone Panel,Hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production.,3.0,18.0,range,mIU/mL,High EPO may occur with hypoxia or doping; low EPO leads to anemia.
Immature Granulocytes %,Haematology,White Cell Differential,"Percentage of immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes) in blood.",0.0,0.4,range,%,Elevated levels may indicate infection or bone marrow stimulation.
Immature Granulocytes Absolute,Haematology,White Cell Differential,Absolute count of immature granulocytes.,0.0,0.03,range,x10^9/L,High absolute counts indicate acute infection or bone marrow stress.
NRBC % (nucleated RBC),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Percent of nucleated red blood cells in circulation.,0.0,0.1,range,%,"Presence of NRBCs may indicate severe stress, hypoxia or bone marrow release due to erythropoietic stimulation."
NRBC Absolute,Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Absolute count of nucleated red blood cells.,0.0,0.01,range,x10^9/L,Elevated levels may signal bone marrow stress or severe hypoxia; unusual in healthy adults.
Hypochromic RBC %,Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Percent of red blood cells with low hemoglobin content.,0.0,2.5,range,%,High percentage indicates iron‑restricted erythropoiesis; may result from iron deficiency or inflammation.
Reticulocyte Hemoglobin (CHr),Haematology,Red Cell Indices,Hemoglobin content of reticulocytes measured in picograms.,28.0,35.0,range,pg,Low CHr indicates functional iron deficiency; important when monitoring anemia treatment.
