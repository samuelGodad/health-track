Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT),Liver Function,Liver Enzyme Panel,Liver enzyme that rises with hepatocellular injury or some oral steroids.,7.0,56.0,range,U/L,Elevated ALT suggests liver stress from oral compounds or high protein intake.
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST),Liver Function,Liver Enzyme Panel,Enzyme found in liver and muscle; rises after heavy training or liver damage.,10.0,40.0,range,U/L,High AST may reflect muscle damage from intense workouts or liver injury from compounds.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP),Liver Function,Liver Enzyme Panel,Enzyme from liver and bone; high in cholestasis or bone growth.,44.0,147.0,range,U/L,Elevations may indicate bile duct obstruction or rapid bone turnover.
Gamma‑Glutamyl Transferase (GGT),Liver Function,Liver Enzyme Panel,Enzyme sensitive to bile duct and alcohol‑related liver injury.,9.0,48.0,range,U/L,High GGT can indicate cholestasis from oral steroids or excessive alcohol consumption.
Total Bilirubin,Liver Function,Bilirubin Panel,Yellow pigment from hemoglobin breakdown; measured as total (direct + indirect).,0.3,1.2,range,mg/dL,Elevated bilirubin can signal impaired liver clearance or hemolysis; mild increases may occur after heavy training.
Direct Bilirubin,Liver Function,Bilirubin Panel,Conjugated form processed by the liver for excretion.,0.0,0.3,range,mg/dL,High direct bilirubin points to bile duct obstruction or cholestatic injury.
Indirect Bilirubin,Liver Function,Bilirubin Panel,Unconjugated bilirubin calculated as total minus direct.,0.2,0.9,range,mg/dL,"Elevated levels may indicate hemolysis, Gilbert’s syndrome or increased turnover."
Albumin,Liver Function,Liver Synthesis Panel,Major plasma protein produced by the liver.,3.5,5.2,range,g/dL,Low albumin suggests poor liver synthetic function or malnutrition; affects drug binding.
Total Protein,Liver Function,Liver Synthesis Panel,Sum of albumin and globulins in serum.,6.0,8.3,range,g/dL,High or low total protein reflects nutrition status and chronic inflammation.
Globulin (calculated),Liver Function,Liver Synthesis Panel,Calculated as total protein minus albumin; includes antibodies and transport proteins.,2.0,3.5,range,g/dL,High globulin may indicate chronic inflammation; low may reflect poor immune status.
Albumin/Globulin Ratio (A/G Ratio),Liver Function,Liver Synthesis Panel,Ratio of albumin to globulins; evaluates balance between synthesis and immune proteins.,1.0,2.5,range,ratio,Low A/G ratio may signal liver disease or chronic inflammation; high ratio may indicate low globulins.
Prothrombin Time (PT),Liver Function,Clotting Panel,Time required for blood to clot via the extrinsic pathway.,11.0,13.5,range,seconds,Prolonged PT indicates impaired liver synthesis of clotting factors or vitamin K deficiency.
International Normalized Ratio (INR),Liver Function,Clotting Panel,Standardized ratio of prothrombin time across laboratories.,0.9,1.2,range,ratio,High INR reflects poor liver function or anticoagulant use; monitor when stacking hepatotoxic agents.
AST/ALT Ratio (calculated),Liver Function,Calculated Ratios,Ratio of AST to ALT; helps differentiate alcoholic liver disease from other causes.,0.5,1.5,range,ratio,High ratio (>2) may point toward alcohol‑related injury; low ratio suggests anabolic steroid impact.
GGT/ALT Ratio (calculated),Liver Function,Calculated Ratios,Ratio of gamma‑GT to ALT; indicates cholestatic vs hepatocellular injury.,0.0,3.0,range,ratio,High ratio suggests cholestasis from oral steroids; used to interpret enzyme elevations.
Prealbumin (Transthyretin),Liver Function,Liver Synthesis Panel,Short‑lived transport protein; sensitive indicator of protein status.,20.0,40.0,range,mg/dL,Low levels reflect malnutrition or severe liver dysfunction; useful when cutting calories.
Bile Acids (Total),Liver Function,Bile Acid Panel,Sum of bile acids circulating in blood; elevated in cholestatic disorders.,0.0,10.0,less_than,µmol/L,High bile acids suggest impaired bile flow; some oral steroids can cause cholestasis.
NAFLD Fibrosis Score (calculated),Liver Function,Calculated Ratios,Composite score predicting fibrosis in non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease.,-3.5,-1.5,range,score,Higher scores suggest advanced fibrosis; bulking with excessive calories or steroids may worsen NAFLD.
