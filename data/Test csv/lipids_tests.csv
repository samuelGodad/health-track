Total Cholesterol,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Standard Lipid Panel,Sum of cholesterol carried by all lipoproteins in the blood.,0.0,200.0,less_than,mg/dL,High levels raise cardiovascular risk; athletes monitor to keep heart healthy.
LDL Cholesterol,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Standard Lipid Panel,‘Bad’ cholesterol associated with plaque build‑up in arteries.,0.0,100.0,less_than,mg/dL,Lower LDL helps maintain vascular health during bulking or steroid use.
HDL Cholesterol,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Standard Lipid Panel,‘Good’ cholesterol that helps remove cholesterol from arteries.,40.0,100.0,greater_than,mg/dL,Higher HDL protects against heart disease; some steroids reduce HDL.
Triglycerides,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Standard Lipid Panel,Blood fats derived from dietary fat and carbohydrate metabolism.,0.0,150.0,less_than,mg/dL,Elevated triglycerides signal poor diet or insulin resistance; monitor during bulk phases.
Non‑HDL Cholesterol,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Standard Lipid Panel,Total cholesterol minus HDL; represents all atherogenic particles.,0.0,130.0,less_than,mg/dL,Better risk marker than LDL alone; keep low to protect vascular health.
Apolipoprotein B (ApoB),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Apolipoprotein Panel,Protein on LDL and VLDL particles; counts atherogenic particles.,60.0,100.0,range,mg/dL,Stronger predictor of heart disease than LDL; high values may prompt dietary changes.
Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Apolipoprotein Panel,Main protein component of HDL particles.,120.0,200.0,range,mg/dL,Higher ApoA1 reflects robust HDL function and cardioprotection.
Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)],Lipids & Cardiovascular,Apolipoprotein Panel,Genetic LDL‑like particle with an attached apolipoprotein(a).,0.0,30.0,less_than,mg/dL,High Lp(a) is a strong genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis; unaffected by diet or exercise.
High‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Inflammatory Panel,Sensitive marker of systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk.,0.0,3.0,less_than,mg/L,Elevated hs‑CRP may indicate overtraining or underlying inflammation affecting recovery.
Homocysteine,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Cardiovascular Risk Panel,Amino acid produced during methionine metabolism; high levels are harmful.,5.0,15.0,range,µmol/L,Elevated homocysteine can damage blood vessels; improved by B‑vitamin intake.
Creatine Kinase (CK),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Muscle Damage Panel,Enzyme released from muscle cells after exercise or injury.,40.0,200.0,range,U/L,Markedly elevated CK indicates muscle damage; helps gauge recovery needs.
CK‑MB,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Cardiac Markers Panel,Creatine kinase isoenzyme more specific to cardiac muscle.,0.0,5.0,less_than,ng/mL,Helps rule out heart injury; should remain low in healthy athletes.
Troponin I (high sensitivity),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Cardiac Markers Panel,Highly specific marker of heart muscle damage.,0.0,14.0,less_than,ng/L,Elevated troponin indicates heart strain or injury; important when combining stimulants with exercise.
NT‑proBNP,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Cardiac Markers Panel,Peptide released from heart when it is under strain or volume overload.,0.0,125.0,less_than,pg/mL,High levels can signal heart stress from high blood pressure or heavy cycling doses.
VLDL Cholesterol (calculated),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Subfractions,Estimated triglyceride‑rich very low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol.,5.0,30.0,range,mg/dL,High VLDL indicates elevated triglycerides and potential insulin resistance.
LDL‑P (particle number),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Subfractions,Number of LDL particles measured by NMR.,0.0,1000.0,less_than,nmol/L,High LDL‑P predicts cardiovascular risk even if LDL cholesterol is normal.
Small LDL‑P,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Subfractions,Concentration of small dense LDL particles.,0.0,527.0,less_than,nmol/L,Small dense LDL is more atherogenic; elevated levels increase risk despite normal LDL.
HDL‑P (particle number),Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Subfractions,Number of HDL particles measured by NMR.,30.0,80.0,greater_than,µmol/L,Higher HDL particle counts may confer cardiovascular protection beyond HDL cholesterol.
LDL Size,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Subfractions,Average size of LDL particles in nanometers.,21.0,,greater_than,nm,Larger LDL particles are less atherogenic; diet and exercise influence size.
Total Cholesterol:HDL Ratio,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Ratios,Risk ratio derived by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol.,0.0,4.5,less_than,ratio,Lower ratios indicate a healthier lipid profile; high ratios signal increased risk.
LDL:HDL Ratio,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Ratios,Proportion of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.,0.0,3.5,less_than,ratio,Lower ratios suggest a favorable balance between atherogenic and protective lipoproteins.
Triglyceride:HDL Ratio,Lipids & Cardiovascular,Lipid Ratios,Triglyceride level divided by HDL; surrogate marker for insulin resistance.,0.0,2.0,less_than,ratio,Higher ratios signal poor insulin sensitivity; often elevated when using high‑carb bulking diets.
