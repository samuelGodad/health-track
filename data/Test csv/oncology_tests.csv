Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Protein produced by prostate gland; elevated levels may indicate prostate disease.,0.0,4.0,range,ng/mL,High PSA can indicate prostate enlargement or cancer; some anabolic steroids increase PSA.
Free PSA %,Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Percentage of PSA circulating unbound; used to interpret total PSA levels.,25.0,,greater_than,%,A low free PSA percentage may signal higher risk of prostate cancer; helps distinguish benign enlargement.
Alpha‑Fetoprotein (AFP),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Protein produced by fetal liver; used as tumor marker in adults.,0.0,10.0,range,ng/mL,Elevated AFP may indicate liver or testicular tumors; very high with hepatotoxic steroid use.
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,"Protein used as tumor marker, primarily for colon and other cancers.",0.0,3.0,less_than,ng/mL,Usually low in healthy individuals; elevated values warrant further investigation.
Cancer Antigen 19‑9 (CA 19‑9),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Tumor marker associated with pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancers.,0.0,37.0,less_than,U/mL,Included for completeness; high values rare and warrant medical evaluation.
Cancer Antigen 15‑3 (CA 15‑3),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Tumor marker used mainly for monitoring breast cancer.,0.0,30.0,less_than,U/mL,Rarely elevated in men; included to monitor gynecomastia‑like masses if they occur.
Beta‑human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β‑hCG),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Hormone typically produced during pregnancy; also a marker for testicular and other germ‑cell tumors.,0.0,5.0,less_than,mIU/mL,Elevated β‑hCG in men can indicate testicular tumors or misuse of hCG for steroid cycling.
Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125),Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Tumor marker associated with ovarian and some other cancers.,0.0,35.0,less_than,U/mL,Included for completeness; persistently high values warrant medical attention even in males.
Calcitonin,Oncology Markers,Oncology Screen Panel,Hormone produced by thyroid C‑cells; used to detect medullary thyroid carcinoma.,0.0,10.0,less_than,pg/mL,Elevated calcitonin suggests thyroid C‑cell disease; rarely ordered but added for comprehensive screening.
