Test Name,Category,Panel,Description,Reference Range Min,Reference Range Max,Reference Range Type,Units,Why It Matters for Bodybuilders
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH),Biochemistry,Enzymes Panel,Enzyme present in many tissues released during cell damage or intense exercise.,140.0,280.0,range,U/L,"High LDH indicates tissue damage, hemolysis or strenuous training; persistent elevation warrants evaluation."
Aldolase,Biochemistry,Enzymes Panel,Muscle enzyme involved in glycolysis; elevated with muscle injury or metabolic disorders.,1.0,7.5,range,U/L,High aldolase may reflect muscle breakdown or rare metabolic myopathies; monitor after extreme training.
Anion Gap (calculated),Biochemistry,Electrolytes Panel,Difference between measured cations and anions used to detect metabolic acidosis.,8.0,16.0,range,mmol/L,"Elevated anion gap indicates accumulation of acids from intense exercise, keto dieting or dehydration."
Osmolality (serum),Biochemistry,Fluid Balance Panel,Concentration of dissolved particles in blood measured in milliosmoles per kilogram.,275.0,295.0,range,mOsm/kg,High osmolality reflects dehydration; low values may occur with overhydration or hyponatremia.
Total CO₂ (serum),Biochemistry,Electrolytes Panel,"Measurement of carbon dioxide content in blood, largely as bicarbonate.",22.0,29.0,range,mmol/L,Low values reflect metabolic acidosis; high values may occur with alkalosis or excessive bicarbonate use.
Globulins (total),Biochemistry,Protein Panel,Total globulin proteins calculated as total protein minus albumin.,2.0,3.5,range,g/dL,High globulins suggest chronic inflammation or infection; low globulins reflect immune suppression or malnutrition.
Creatine (serum),Biochemistry,Metabolite Panel,Serum creatine levels influenced by supplementation and muscle turnover.,0.2,1.2,range,mg/dL,High serum creatine may reflect recent supplementation; low levels indicate depletion.
CK to AST Ratio (calculated),Biochemistry,Calculated Ratios,Ratio of creatine kinase to AST used to determine origin of elevated AST.,3.0,,greater_than,ratio,A high ratio (>3) suggests muscle rather than liver as the source of elevated AST.
Fibrinogen,Biochemistry,Coagulation Panel,Plasma protein essential for blood clot formation.,200.0,400.0,range,mg/dL,High fibrinogen increases blood viscosity and clot risk; low levels can lead to bleeding issues.
D‑Dimer,Biochemistry,Coagulation Panel,Fibrin degradation fragment produced when blood clots are broken down.,0.0,500.0,less_than,ng/mL FEU,Elevated D‑dimer signals increased clot formation and breakdown; may occur with injury or thrombosis.
Prothrombin Fragment 1+2,Biochemistry,Coagulation Panel,Peptides released when prothrombin is cleaved to thrombin; marker of thrombin generation.,69.0,229.0,range,pmol/L,High levels indicate increased thrombin activity and clotting potential; used in research panels.
